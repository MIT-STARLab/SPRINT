# Autogenerated (Intermediate) files

These are generated automatically by circinus modules and used as input for further modules. Some are very large, and only minimally human readable. This folder is empty other than this readme until the pipeline is run.

## Expected files to be generated:
* data_rates_output.json : [ runner_orbitlink.py -> runner_const_sim.py ]
* orbit_prop_data.json : [ runner_orbitprop.py -> runner_orbitviz.py ]
* sat_link_history.json : [ runner_orbitlink.py -> runner_orbitviz.py ]
* const_sim_outputs.json : [ runner_const_sim.py -> ]
