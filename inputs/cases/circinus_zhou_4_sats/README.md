# Original CIRCINUS use-case

## Description of Original Zhou use-case:
Cases are fundamentally defined by a constellation and set ground stations, and further specified by an operational profile which defines intended up-time, as well as targets; and by a simulation scenario which defines actual up-time and performance. The SPRINT zhou use case is one of several use cases demonstrated with the first version of CIRCINUS.

## Required Case-specific Configuration Files, in this directory:
* `constellation_config.json`
* `ground_station_network_config.json`
* `operational_profile_config.json`
* `sim_case_config.json`

## Further required in the model definition directory `inputs/reference_model_definitions`:
* `/gs_refs/zhou_original_gs.json`
* `/payload_refs/zhou_original_payload.json`
* `/sat_refs/zhou_original_sat.json`

### Hold on where do I find all these files?
