# Instructions for ONLINE_OPS

Use of ONLINE OPS still requires the basic case-configs as a normal case.   They can be empty of some specifics (satellites, groundstations, start/stop time), which can be filled in by users via provided TCP interface, but the files and structures should still be created.

- constellation_config.json
- ground_station_network_config.json
- operational_profile_config.json
- sim_case_config.json
